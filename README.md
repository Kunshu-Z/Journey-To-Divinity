# Journey-To-Divinity
A 2D platformer game created using Unity URP.

The game is currently still under development with the first act being mostly complete. Second act is currently under development and will be updated.

Note: When attempting to clone the repository to a local machince, it is recommended to not nest the repository within too many files. Doing such may result in an error stating that the directory was too long. Ideally clone it into one folder contained within the start of the drive.
